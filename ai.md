# Levels of AI Mastery
- Level 1: Foundation concepts
    - MCP
        - reaches into software ecosystems outside of AI agent's knowledge via helper processes
    - [skills](https://claude.ai/share/30b3ca0d-cdaa-4e1a-98c2-fd27f252fc09)
        - context efficiency
        - composeability
        - encapsulation of reuseable unit of work
        - supported by multiple vendor products: Claude Code, Codex, Github Copilot and more
        - opens Pandora box of governance challenges more so than MCP, unless if there are guardrails such as entitlement, sandbox or server-side protections
    - [Claude hooks](https://claude.ai/share/fb7be2eb-a1d8-4b05-ac08-0c18f50ed696)
        - lifecycle management
    - [Claude subagent](https://claude.ai/share/8aa3ce3c-1e2a-4ae9-a34a-139b8ff5457d)
        - context management
    - [Claude commands](https://claude.ai/share/2f275c03-4a44-4ef2-9c39-55a70ab21e90)
- Level 2: Better harness
    - orchestrate AI Agents continuously with limit awareness
    - structured storage of conversation history with AI capabilities
    - control over distribution channels: internet-facing web, mobile, local CLI agnostic of vendor-specific solutions
- Level 3: Autonomous
    - automated introspection of execution log to improve token efficiency and reliability
    - automated discovery and organization of knowledge
    - rapid mobilization of information advantage
